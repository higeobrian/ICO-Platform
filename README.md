**Stratis ICO Platform**

Features of the Stratis ICO Platform include:

• A highly customizable design, which enables you to ensure the ICO site conforms with your unique branding.

• The ability to accept funds in USD, BTC, STRAT and 50+ additional cryptocurrencies via Changelly, a service that enables ICO contributors to pay in many digital currencies.

• Integration with Onfido’s ‘Know-Your-Customer’ (KYC) service that screens contributors against anti-money laundering watch-lists and undertakes document checks.

• Support for Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, enabling issuers to collect funds securely. This means the funds collected during the ICO are not stored on the server itself.

• The Stratis ICO Platform is provided free of charge, overcoming the high costs of existing crowd-funding solutions.
